            <h4>PROJECTS</h4>
            <p> I have worked on many projects while in school. My most recent projects are in Java coding at Purdue Northwest and Website Design at Ivy Tech. I enjoyed the team work of the Java Project and the design aspects of the Web Development Project.
                You can find all of my projects at Github. </p>

            <h5>Java Programming</h5>
            <p>This project is to develop an application that interviews a patient for some general medical history data using a binary tree to drive the process. Implemented using the Java language, using the Java Swing graphical user interface and the
                MySQL database to store data. Think of the interview as a digital physician that asks the user questions regarding their medical history.

            <h4>Website Design</h4>
            <p>This project has encouraged me to create a website to showcase my skills and to have all of my information in one place including my projects, code samples and contact information. Specific goals for the website are an organized scheme of
                a current sytle of branding and a unique way of sharing information that might be memorable to visitors. Another goal is to promote myself and my skills by creating a website that doubles as a demonstration of my HTML & CSS abilities.

            <h5>Business Continuitity Plan</h5>
            <p>The Plan that I created outlines the principles of incident response and disaster recovery. The Plan includes identification of vulnerabilities and appropriate countermeasures to prevent and mitigate risks to a ficticious organization. This
                project includes risk assessment, incident response, contingency planning, and prioritizing systems for disaster recovery.

            <h4> Information Security Policy</h4>
            <p>The goal of this policy is to provide an advanced understanding of the concepts involved in firewalls, routers, intrusion detection, intrusion prevention and Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) in relationship to the overall enterprise network
                strategy. I created the policy to outline advanced network security installation techniques; advanced network security troubleshooting; and how to make intelligent choices in firewall and router technology. Additionally, the policy has
                a comprehensive look at the use of routers and switches with other network security components in configuring De-Militarized Zones (DMZ) and VPNs for optimal perimeter security.

            <h5>Ethical Hacking Journal </h5>
            <p>Ethical Hacking Challenge: hack the Password of a zip file. I used Kali Linux and fcrackzip, zippasswordcrackerprov1.4f, John the Ripper within Kali to disclose the content of the ZIP archive without having the password available. The journal
                contains pictures of my work with appropriate annotation with the content of the zip file and a short summary how I solved the challenge.
